# RemindMe Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your RemindMe application to Vercel's free tier.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account (free tier is sufficient)
- Your RemindMe project code (from Replit)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Export Your Code from Replit

First, you need to download your project from Replit:

1. In Replit, click on the three dots (...) in the files panel
2. Select "Download as zip"
3. Extract the ZIP file to your local machine

### 2. Create a GitHub Repository (Optional but Recommended)

For easier deployment and future updates:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload your extracted files to this repository

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Keep all default settings
5. Click "Deploy"

#### Option B: Deploy from Local Files

1. Install the Vercel CLI
2. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal
3. Login to Vercel and follow the deployment prompts

### 4. Configure Deployment Settings (If Needed)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings"
2. Under "Build & Development Settings", make sure:
   - Build Command is set to: ./build.sh
   - Output Directory is set to: dist

### 5. Verify Your Deployment

1. Once deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL
2. Visit this URL to ensure your application is working correctly
3. Test the reminder functionality and PWA installation

## PWA Installation on Mobile Devices

### Android

1. Open your deployed app URL in Chrome
2. Tap the three dots menu
3. Select "Add to Home screen"
4. Follow the prompts to install the app

### iOS

1. Open your deployed app URL in Safari
2. Tap the Share button
3. Scroll down and select "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add" to confirm

## Troubleshooting

- API Errors: Check API paths in queryClient.ts
- PWA Not Installing: Verify manifest.json and service-worker.js
- Build Failures: Review build logs in Vercel

## Maintenance

To update your deployed application:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Push to GitHub or redeploy manually
